# CSI-180-Manga

A website that will allow users to mark different series that they are collecting in book form as a method to keep track of what they have or not in an easier way. It will include a method to search for different series so the user can add them to their collection. From there, all the series will have different buttons for the different series that will be toggleable so the user can toggle on and off what series they own so that when they buy some or if they lose any they can change the status of the series.
